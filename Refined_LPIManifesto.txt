\begin{preamblebox}
We, the Libertarian Party of India, believe every individual possesses the inherent right to self-rule (\textit{swaraj}) and to live freely without harming others. We envision a world of sovereign individuals, free from coercion, where force and fraud are rejected. True peace and prosperity flourish only in liberty.

Drawing strength from India's enduring traditions of tolerance, pluralism, and voluntary cooperation, we declare that the moral arc of progress bends toward individual empowerment, not state control. We pledge to defend and fulfill our Constitution's mandate of liberty, equality, and fraternity—its sacred trust.

\textbf{Our Core Principle: The Non-Aggression Principle}

We believe that no individual or institution has the right to initiate force or fraud against another. All human interactions must be voluntary, peaceful, and based on mutual consent.
\end{preamblebox}

\vspace{1cm}

\begin{visionbox}
We envision a nation where dignity, security, and freedom are not privileges for the few but the birthright of every citizen. A nation where liberty is real, rooted in everyday life, and guided by moral principles that unite us.

In this India, everyone has access to life's essentials—food, shelter, healthcare, and education—ensuring no one is trapped in mere survival. True freedom begins when the daily struggle ends, allowing people to dream, create, and build.

We will be a nation of progress where entrepreneurs, artists, engineers, and creators find room to flourish. A civilization of excellence that transcends divisions of caste, creed, and class. An India that stands tall among nations not by conquering others, but by empowering its people.
\end{visionbox}

% Restructured section hierarchy
\section{FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS} % Section 1

\subsection{Freedom of Expression} % 1.1
\begin{sectionbox}{Freedom of Expression}
Freedom of speech is non-negotiable. A free society must tolerate dissent, satire, unpopular opinions, and criticism of power without fear of censorship.

\end{enumerate}
\end{sectionbox}

\subsection{Religious Freedom} % 1.2
\begin{sectionbox}{Religious Freedom}
The state has no role in regulating temples or religious practices. Every community must manage its own places of worship without political interference.

\textbf{Our Actions:}
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
\item Repeal the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act
\item Ensure complete separation of religion and state

\end{enumerate}
\end{sectionbox}

\subsection{Right to Self-Defense} % 1.3
\begin{sectionbox}{Right to Self-Defense}
The right to bear arms is the ultimate check against tyranny. Responsible citizens must be empowered, not criminalized, for choosing to protect themselves and their families.

\end{enumerate}
\end{sectionbox}

\subsection{Revolutionary Tax Reform} % 2.2

\end{sectionbox}

\begin{sectionbox}{End Government Business Operations}
The government is not an entrepreneur and shouldn't pretend to be one. Every rupee spent running businesses is taken from taxpayers to fund inefficiency and corruption.

\textbf{Our Actions:}
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
\item Close or privatize all government-run businesses
\item Exit sectors including airlines, hotels, factories, and telecom

\item Transfer authority from center to states and localities
\item Empower communities to solve their own problems
